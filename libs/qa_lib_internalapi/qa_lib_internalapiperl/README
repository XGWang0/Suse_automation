this is the perl-binding subset for the rd-qa internal testscript-api
libqainternal (which has to be installed for this to work)


Compile & Install
=================
To compile this u need the swig-framework installed.
First a 
"make -f Makefile.swig" and
"make -f Makefile.swig install" (as root)
will produce and install the needed wrappers written in c.

Afterwards the typical perl-version of those are needed:
"perl Makefile.PL", 
"make" and
"make install" (as root)




USAGE
=====
Just use the libqainternal-perlbinding via
"use libqainternalperl;"

and later on via libqainternalperl::.... exactly as in the original
c-library
the only little difference: when using functions with output via
arguments (the _out arguments) you have to use reference arguments

As an example you should use the included demo_use_perl.pl 
program.
