.SH DISTRIBUTION
It is an open-source project that we have taken internally and to which we have made significant modifications. As such, it remains under an open-source license, however, we have not yet distributed our own internal changes to the community yet, but we are in the process of doing so, but it is difficult due to the many changes that we've made (so we weill either release it fully as a separate project, try to merge it into the original upstream project somehow, or at the very least just as a fork).
.SH LICENSE
GPL v2 or later
