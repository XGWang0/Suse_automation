/*
  PURPOSE:
  ========
  - The purpose of this file is to have common CSS declarations that can be used between tools.
  - The reason for this is because of the many conficting declarations between Hamsta and QADB.
  - Eventually, we will do a full merge of the CSS declarations between the two tools/libraries
    and then this file can go away.
