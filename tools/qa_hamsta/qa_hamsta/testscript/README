====Caution!!!====
"Smoke test" and "test all" are done by "custome test" now, Triggered by validation test in pre-defined job list.
"Custom test" receives a parameter list, which stands for the test suite list.
Please make sure SLES, SDK and QA repos are added before test.(This could be done when you reinstall this machine.)
This work suppose to be done by reinstall.pl, anyway you can also add/modify manually if it dosen't work.

Usage:
============
you'd better start a screen before tests.
./customtest <package list>

It includes install, run, summary, report and submit procedues.


Other scripts
=================
./go is used for summary, report and submit when the validation tests are done.
