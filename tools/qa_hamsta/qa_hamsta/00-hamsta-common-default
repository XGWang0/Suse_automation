# Multicast configuration

# IMPORTANT:
# This is a multicast address hamsta master listens on. 
# However, if hamsta master is not reachable on the client via
# its multicast address, the value of hamsta_multicast_address
# can be set to the (real) master's IP of on *client*!. Client 
# will than connect directly. This can be used when multicast is
# not routed from client to server and it is not possible/desired
# to setup multicast-forwarder
hamsta_multicast_address='239.192.10.10'

hamsta_multicast_port='2000'
