.SH NAME
feed_hamsta.pl \- Hamsta command-line client
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B feed_hamsta.pl
[\fIOPTIONS\fR] \fIMASTER\fR[:\fIPORT\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
Hamsta command-line client.
.PP
This program provides some basic functionality to interact with Hamsta
master. It does not support all functionality Hamsta provides on web
frontend but it is possible to send different kinds of jobs, list
machines and their states and execute arbitrary commands as machine
jobs.

Depending on the Hamsta master configuration you might need to log in
to the master. You should use the \fIlogin\fR and \fIpassword\fR you
have set at the Hamsta web. These might be different than you use with
other types of web authentication like OpenID.

The protocol used to communicate with master is sometimes changed (e.g
with introduction of new commands). Before the protocol version was
implemented it caused issues. Since version 2.8 the protocol version
is checked by default. If the master does not support the protocol
version this client implements, the connection is closed and client
exits with status 1.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB\-U\fR=\fILOGIN\fR, \fB\-\-user\fR=\fILOGIN\fR
Authenticate as user with \fILOGIN\fR.
.TP
\fB\-P\fR=\fIPASS\fR, \fB\-\-password\fR=\fIPASS\fR
User's password.

\fINote:\fR This may not be the same password that you use to log into
the Web UI. See Hamsta password settings in the Web UI for details.
.TP
\fB\-p\fR, \fB\-\-print-active\fR
Prints list of machines active at the Hamsta \fIMASTER\fR.
.TP
\fB\-h\fR=\fIHOST\fR, \fB\-\-host\fR=\fIHOST\fR
Machine to work with. The \fIHOST\fR can be the machine's hostname or IP address.
.TP
\fB\-x\fR=\fICOMMAND\fR, \fB\-\-cmd\fR=\fICOMMAND\fR
Executes an arbitrary \fICOMMAND\fR.
.TP
\fB\-t\fR=\fIN\fR, \fB\-\-jobtype\fR=\fIN\fR
Sets the group of jobs to work with, either for job listing or
execution. The \fIN\fR is an integer in range from 1 to 5 inclusive.

The \fIN\fR has following meanings.

    \fB1\fR \- Single machine job
    \fB2\fR \- QA package job
    \fB3\fR \- Autotest job
    \fB4\fR \- Multi machine job
    \fB5\fR \- Reinstall job
.TP
\fB\-l\fR, \fB\-\-listcases\fR
List the testcases given the jobtype (the jobtype must be set). Does
not work for jobtype 5.
.TP
\fB\-n\fR, \fB\-\-testname\fR
Testname to be executed given the jobtype. Only works with jobtypes from 1 to 4.
.TP
\fB\-u\fR=\fIURL\fR, \fB\-\-re_url\fR=\fIURL\fR
Reinstallation source \fIURL\fR. Works only with jobtype 5.
.TP
\fB\-\-re_sdk\fR=\fIURL\fR
The SDK source \fIURL\fR. Only works with jobtype 5.
.TP
\fB\-\-pattern\fR=\fIPAT\fR[,\fIPAT\fR...]
Use one or more installation patterns during the installation. Only
works with jobtype 5.
.TP
\fB\-\-rpms\fR=\fIRPM\fR[,\fIRPM\fR...]
Install also \fIRPM\fR packages. Only works with jobtype 5.
.TP
\fB\-\-roles\fR=\fIROLESPEC\fR
Assign \fIHOST\fRs to roles according to \fIROLESPEC\fR. Only works
with the jobtype 5. The \fIROLESPEC\fR (role specification) general
format is following.

    r0:host1[,host2...][;r1:host3[,host4...]...]

The role number starts at 0 and increments by one. There can be any
number of hosts in each role but at least one.
.TP
\fB\-\-kexec\fR
Reload using \fBkexec\fR(8). Only works with the jobtype 5.
.TP
\fB\-m\fR=\fIADDRESS\fR, \fB\-\-mail\fR=\fIADDRESS\fR
Use the mail \fIADDRESS\fR to send notification when job
completes. The notification contains basic information about the job
result.
.TP
\fB\-\-force\-version\-ignore\fR
Do not check protocol version. The version checking is simply not
done. You have no way of knowing if the protocol is supported or
not. This option is mainly for development purposes.
.TP
\fB\-\-help\fR
.SH EXAMPLES
.TP
feed_hamsta.pl -p hamsta.master.foo
Prints list of active machines at 'hamsta.master.foo'.
.TP
feed_hamsta.pl -t 1 -l hamsta.master.foo
Prints possible single machine jobs.
.PP
\fBFor all actions that modify the machine user must register the
machine in Web UI beforehand.\fR
.TP
feed_hamsta.pl -U user -P password -h machine_name -t 1 -n reboot hamsta.master.foo
Reboots the machine 'machine_name'.
.TP
feed_hamsta.pl -U user -P password -h machine_name -x 'uname -a' hamsta.master.foo
Executes command 'uname -a' on machine 'machine_name'.
.TP
feed_hamsta.pl -U user -P password -h machine_name -t 5 -m user@email.com -u http://reinstall.server.foo/install/SLES-11/x86_64/DVD1/
Starts reinstallation for the machine 'machine_name' using repository
specified by the URL and sends an email to the 'user@email.com' once it
is finished.
.SH COMMON PROBLEMS
The protocol between Hamsta master and this script is \fInot\fR
stable. Since Hamsta version 2.8 the protocol version is checked by
default. If the protocol version is not supported by master the client
exits. If this causes issues it is possible to override default
behaviour with the \fB\-\-force\-ignore\-version\fR option.
