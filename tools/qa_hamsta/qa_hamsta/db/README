======================
DB with update support
======================

This directory contain a database definition with update support.
The initial state of database is in the file create_unpatched_db.sql.
This file contains a database definition version 0 (actually version 
000000000000, see later).  

If you ever want to do some modification to the database, you are not 
allowed to change any existing file in this directory. Instead, you create 
the sql script which will modify the database to the required state. The
script must be stored in directory patches, and must have name in following
format: TIMESTAMP_description.sql

TIMESTAMP is a datetime in format: YYYYMMDDhhmm

Example: patches/201007301505_the_sample_sql_script.sql

To apply the patch(es) to the database, script update_db.sh is used, this script 
reads the current version from the DB (version is a timestamp of the last 
applied patch), and then it applies all the patches with higher version (=newer
timestamp) - in order in which the patches were created.

Script update_db is safe to be run repeatedly, since it won't try to apply same 
patches again.

To create new DB, use the script create_db.sh. The script crates new DB from 
the create_unpatched_db.sql file and than runs the update_db.sh, which will bring
the DB to the up-to-date state.

Never change any file in this directory, if you find that there is something 
wrong in some patch, create a new one, which would fix the problem, don't fix
the bug inside the exiting patch! Someone can already have the wrong patch 
applied!
