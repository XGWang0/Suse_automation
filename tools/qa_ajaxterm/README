1. where to put ajaxterm?
-------------------------
All files are installed in /usr/lib/qa_ajaxterm/

2. daemonize
------------
After installed ajaxterm package, there will be a /etc/init.d/ajaxterm. you can use /etc/init.d/ajaxterm <start|stop|restart> to control the daemon.
And it will be auto started while boot


Integration with HAMSTA
+++++++++++++++++++++++
1. ajaxterm will be auto installed with hamsta-frontend. You can use terminal and vnc (if gnome installed on SUT and configured by /usr/lib/qa_ajaxterm/ajaxterm-vnc script) in the hamsta index page

2. the webserver did a proxy. Any request to qa_ajaxterm/ will be redirected to http://localhost:8022

ProxyPass /qa_ajaxterm/ http://localhost:8022/
ProxyPassReverse /qa_ajaxterm/ http://localhost:8022/

3. About enable vnc. As mentioned after ajaxterm installation, you need to copy /usr/lib/qa_ajaxterm/ajaxterm-vnc to SUTs that have gnome desktop installed. Then just run it to enable vnc. The first time it will require setting a password, recommend to set it as "susetesting".
