.SH DESCRIPTION
For many years, QADB (the “QA Database”) has served as the primary test results repository for automated testing within SUSE. All automated test results and logs can be sent to and stored by QADB for later retrieval and comparison. QADB supports both functional (pass/fail) and performance/benchmark (quantitative) test results. Regression analysis can be performed on both types of results, with performance results being shown in tabular and graphical format for easier consumption.
.br
The QADB user interface was developed using PHP and JavaScript and uses a MySQL database capable of storing and quickly retrieving millions of automated test results. QADB is packaged in an RPM for easy installation and updating.
