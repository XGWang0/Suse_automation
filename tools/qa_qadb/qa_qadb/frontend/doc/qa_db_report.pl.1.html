<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       <B>qa_db_report.pl</B>   reads   CTCS2   result   directories   (default    in
       /var/log/ctcs2),  stores  the results into QADB (server can be set with
       <B>select_db.pl(1)</B> ), copies the logs  to  the  archive  using  <B>scp(1)</B>  on
       <I>qainst.suse.de:/suse/rd-qa/Exports/Results</I>  ,  and  moves the processed
       log to a subdirectory named <I>oldlogs/.</I>

       The most of the options should have sane default values, but  you  need
       to specify at least the product.

<H2>OPTIONS</H2><PRE>
       <B>-a</B> <B>arch</B>
              Here  you  can  specify  the  architecture.   Architecture  must
              already exist in QADB, table architectures.  When  omitted,  the
              script tries to auto-detect it.


       <B>-A</B>     Do not copy the logs to the archive using SCP.


       <B>-b</B>     Batch  processing  - not interactive, does not ask for confirma-
              tions.  When <I>hwinfo</I> or <I>rpmlist</I> is missing, prints a warning  and
              generates  it automatically, using current machine's data.  When
              multiple submissions would be created due to multiple  different
              RPM or hwinfo configurations, the script fails.

              Batch  processing also fails, when you have no user/password set
              in <B>.mysql_loc.rc(5)</B>


       <B>-c</B> <B>comment</B>
              Here you can specify the comment related to your  submission(s).



       <B>-C</B>     Commits after every submitted testsuite.  By default, the script
              commits at the end of the database work.  With this  switch,  it
              commits after each testsuite is stored.  This makes the transac-
              tions smaller (however MySQL should be able to handle with large
              transactions  as  well).   You  also  can  see the data in QADB,
              before the submit process is finished.

              <B>NOTE</B> Submission type is set at the end of the whole submit  pro-
              cess, so you cannot see it in QADB earlier.

              When  the submit fails, the newly inserted data are deleted from


       <B>-m</B> <B>testhost</B>
              The machine you ran the tests on.  By default  hostname  of  the
              current machine.


       <B>-p</B> <B>product-release</B>
              This  is  the only mandatory switch.  Product must already exist
              in QADB, table products.  Release  will  be  created,  when  not
              known in QADB.

              Example : SLES-10-beta1 , SLES-9-SP4-RC1 , ...


              Currently,  following  architectures  exist:  i586,  ia64,  ppc,
              ppc64,   s390,   s390x,    x86_64,    xen0-i586,    xen0-x86_64,
              xen0-x86_64-xenU-i586, xenU-i586, xenU-x86_64


       <B>-t</B> <B>type</B>
              Submission type.
              <B>product</B>
                     The  default  submission  type,  means  that  you  submit
                     results from a product test.
              <B>patch:&lt;md5sum&gt;</B>
                     Testing     a     patch      with      given      md5sum.
                     <I>/mounts/work/built/patchinfo</I> with details about the spec-
                     ified patch  must  be  available,  otherwise  the  submit
                     fails.
              <B>kotd:&lt;release&gt;:&lt;version&gt;:&lt;branch&gt;</B>
                     This one means that you submit results from Kernel of the
                     day testing, with  given  kernel  release,  version,  and
                     branch.


       <B>-v</B> <B>&lt;n&gt;</B> Sets  the verbosity level.  Default value is 5, you can set fol-
              lowing values:

              0 : no messages at all
              1 : critical errors
              2 : errors
              3 : warnings
              4 : notices
              5 : info
              6 : details
              7 : debug messages

              All messages are sent to <B>STDERR.</B>
