<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       remote_qa_db_report.pl  reads  test  result  directories  (default   in
       /var/log/qa), compresses them and copies via SCP to rd-qa@qadb.suse.de,
       remotely runs <B><A HREF="qa_db_report.pl.1.html">qa_db_report.pl(1)</A></B> to store the results into QADB, copies
       the logs to the archive at qainst.suse.de:/suse/rd-qa/Exports/Results ,
       and moves the processed log to a subdirectory named oldlogs/.

       The most of the options should have sane default values, but  you  need
       to specify at least the product.




</PRE>
<H2>OPTIONS</H2><PRE>
       -a arch
              Here  you  can  specify  the  architecture.   Architecture  must
              already exist in QADB, table architectures.  When  omitted,  the
              script tries to auto-detect it.


       -A     Do not copy the logs to the archive using SCP.


       -b     Batch  processing  - not interactive, does not ask for confirma-
              tions.  When hwinfo or rpmlist is missing, prints a warning  and
              generates  it automatically, using current machine's data.  Mul-
              tiple submissions caused by multiple  different  RPM  or  hwinfo
              configurations are automatically created.


       -c comment
              Here you can specify the comment related to your submission(s).


              NOTE  Submission  type  is  set  at  the end of the whole submit
              process, so you cannot see it in QADB earlier.

              When the submit fails, the newly inserted data are deleted  from
              the  database  again  (you  will  need  the DELETE privilege for
              that).



       -D     Do not write to the database.


       -f path


       -P DIRECT_PATH_LIST
              comma-separated  list  of  parser:directory  pairs.  This allows
              specification of directories which contain individual  testsuite
              results  without the need to have them in typical results struc-
              ture (dir/parser/testsuite-timestamp). The directory still  MUST
              have  a name in format testsuite-timestamp!  If this argument is
              used, arguments -F and/or -f and/or -R  cannot  be  used!   This
              argument implies (automatically sets) -L!

              Example: -P 'ctcs2:/tmp/qa_siege-2009-12-03-11-13-37'


       -k KERNEL
              Kernel version for KOTD tests


       -L     Do not moves logs to oldlogs.



       -m testhost
              The  machine  you  ran the tests on.  By default hostname of the
              current machine.


       -p product-release
              This is the only mandatory switch.  Product must  already  exist
              in  QADB,  table  products.   Release  will be created, when not
              known in QADB.

              Example : SLES-10-beta1 , SLES-9-SP4-RC1 , ...


              Currently,  following  architectures  exist:  i586,  ia64,  ppc,
              ppc64,    s390,    s390x,    x86_64,   xen0-i586,   xen0-x86_64,
              xen0-x86_64-xenU-i586, xenU-i586, xenU-x86_64


       -t type
              Submission type.
              product
                     The  default  submission  type,  means  that  you  submit
                     results from a product test.
              patch:&lt;md5sum&gt;
                     Testing      a      patch      with     given     md5sum.
                     /mounts/work/built/patchinfo with details about the spec-
                     ified  patch  must  be  available,  otherwise  the submit
                     fails.
              kotd:&lt;release&gt;:&lt;version&gt;:&lt;branch&gt;:&lt;flavor&gt;
                     This one means that you submit results from Kernel of the

              3 : warnings
              4 : notices
              5 : info
              6 : details
              7 : debug messages

              All messages are sent to STDERR.




</PRE>
<H2>KNOWN BUGS</H2><PRE>
       Inotify  not  yet implemented, you cannot submit your results while the
       test runs.
