perl-XML-Dumper
.SH SYNOPSIS
None.
.SH TYPE
tool
.SH DESCRIPTION
XML::Dumper dumps Perl data to XML format. XML::Dumper can also read XML data that was previously dumped by the module and convert it back to Perl. You can use the module to read the XML from a file and write the XML to a file. Perl objects are blessed back to their original packaging; if the modules are installed on the system where the perl objects are reconstituted from xml, they will behave as expected. Intuitively, if the perl objects are converted and reconstituted in the same environment, all should be well. And it is.
