.SH DESCRIPTION
This module provides an intuitive, Perl-ish way to write forkingprograms by letting you use blocks to illustrate which code sectionexecutes in which fork. The code for the parent, child, retry handlerand error handler are grouped together in a "fork block". The clausesmay appear in any order, but they must be consecutive (without anyother statements in between).
