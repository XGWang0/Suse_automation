perl-Carp-Clan
.SH SYNOPSIS
None.
.SH TYPE
tool
.SH DESCRIPTION
This module reports errors from the perspective of the caller of a "clan" of modules, similar to "Carp.pm" itself. But instead of giving it a number of levels to skip on the calling stack, you give it a pattern to characterize the package names of the "clan" of modules that should never be blamed for errors. It makes these modules stick together like a "clan" and any error that occurs will be blamed on the "outsider" script or modules not belonging to this "clan".
